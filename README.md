How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by checking it over and testing. Checking over the code in chunks while working on it is the first line of testing. Just looking for any syntax errors is one way to prevent future problems. The better way to ensure functionality and security is by testing the code. Doing this in units allows you to ensure that all of your code is covered. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs through information collection with the customer. This can be done simply through conversation to understand what they are looking for from the system. These are directly incorporated into the program because they make the requirements for your program. The user needs are going to be the basis for the code that you develop. 

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design first by collecting all of the inforamtion I need from the customer. This is how I develop the requirements and also how the code is going to be set up. From there I look at the requirements one by one and plan out how I'm going to incorporate that in the code. This is all done through various diagrams. I use this information to actually develop the program and then I test it to make sure that it works to the customer's needs.
